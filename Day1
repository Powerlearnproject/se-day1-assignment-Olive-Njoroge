Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
A professional who builds apps, games and websites and also solves real world problems through technology by designing apps and systems, writing code and fixing bugs


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 Learn the basics (like how to write simple instructions). 
 Build small projects (like calculators or simple games).
 Work on real-world projects (like websites or apps)


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Designing apps and systems that users love - creating system architecture
Writing code that makes things work smoothly - based on design
fixing bugs - this ensures optimal functionality

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach to software development, where each phase is completed before moving to the next and it would be appropriate for Projects with well-defined, fixed requirements while Agile methodology is a flexible approach where software is developed in small, incremental cycles  and it would be appropriate for projects where requirements are expected to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A  Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software solutions. He Writes, tests, and debugs code using programming languages.
A  Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the software meets quality standards by testing for bugs, usability, and performance issues. He/She ensures software meets functional and non-functional requirements.
A Project Manager oversees the software development process, ensuring projects are completed on time, within budget, and meet business goals. HE/SHe coordinates between developers, designers, and stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. An exampl VS Code.
A VCS is a tool that tracks changes in source code, allowing collaboration and history management. An example is github


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Managing Time and Meeting Deadlines - Set realistic deadlines and prioritize tasks and break tasks into smaller milestones and use Agile or Scrum methodologies.
 Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes - Follow tech blogs, online courses, and documentation. Also engage in coding communities .
 Debugging and Fixing Bugs - Use debugging tools e,g chrome devtools.
  Effective Team Communication and Collaboration - Maintain clear documentation for tasks and code.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - Tests individual components (functions, methods, or modules) in isolation. It detects bugs early in development.
Integration Testing - Tests how different modules or components work together. It prevents failures caused by mismatched data formats.
System Testing - Tests the complete application as a whole. It ensures end-to-end functionality.
Acceptance Testing - Conducted by end-users to confirm the software meets their requirements. it ensures software meets business goals.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering  is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models.
Importances:
Enhances AI Output Quality
Improves AI Model Efficiency
Tailors AI Responses to Specific Needs
Reduces Ambiguity and Bias
Optimizes AI for Real-World Applications


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - Which is the best food?
Improved prompt - You're a food critic who has travelled all over the world. Which dish would you say is the best one. I need one specific dish.
The improved prompt is better since it provides context and asks for a single dish while the other prompt was broad.
